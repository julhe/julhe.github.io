      <description>For Lucid Trips I&amp;rsquo;ve needed a fast technique to provide reflection to a water surface. Not only was the surface large, it was also a sphere. A single reflection probe didn&amp;rsquo;t looked so well. But what would happend if we use thousands instead of one? I&amp;rsquo;ve made a prototype in Unity:
 Not bad, huh?
Reflections by the surface While this looks good enough, with this amount of probes it&amp;rsquo;s a engine meltdown.</description>

      <description>In virtual reality, vignetting is a handy tool to fight motion sickness, games like Eagle Flight do this and also our beloved Lucid Trips!
Lucid Trips with vignettingBut the &amp;ldquo;stock&amp;rdquo; vignette that we copy from traditional games is actually not made for in-your-face-screens. This might not be obvious in the first place, but once you see the raw vignette, it makes your eyes literally hurt.
The reason is simple: the screen center, which is also center of the vignett, is not the eye center.</description>
